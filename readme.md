# Jobly Backend

A project at the end of our express unit. Given the starter code, we then had to implement:

* document and test sqlForPartialUpdate
* add filtering to Companies
* change authorization for companies/users and write tests
* Add a feature for jobs to the application so we had to write a Job model, routes, and tests
* Added a POST /users/:username/jobs/:id. They gave us the applications table but we had to integrate it



To run this:

    node server.js
    
To run the tests:

    jest -i
